# Edited repo for task 2 of the JPMC software engineering program.

Purpose: Fixes a client-side web application so that it displays a graph that automatically updates a stock's top asking price relative to its timestamp as it gets data from the server application, and aggregates duplicated data. Previously, the web application only got data every time the 'Start Streaming Data' button was clicked.
